    "- Text can be part of the variables in our datasets. \n",
    "- For example, in insurance, some variables that capture information about an incident may come from a free text field in a form. \n",
    "- In data from a website that collects customer reviews or feedback, we may also encounter variables that contain short descriptions provided by text that has been entered manually by the users. \n",
    "- Text is unstructured, that is, it does not follow a pattern, like the tabular pattern of the datasets we have worked with throughout this book. \n",
    "- Text may also vary in length and content, and the writing style may be different. \n",
    "- How can we extract information from text variables to inform our predictive models? \n",
    "- This is the question we are going to address in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The techniques we will cover in this chapter belong to the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP). \n",
    "- NLP is a subfield of linguistics and computer science, concerned with the interactions between computer and human language, or, in other words, how to program computers to understand human language. \n",
    "- NLP includes a multitude of techniques to understand the syntax, semantics, and discourse of text, and therefore to do this field justice would require a book in itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this chapter, instead, we will discuss those techniques that will allow us to quickly extract features from short pieces of text, to complement our predictive models.\n",
    "- Specifically, we will discuss how to capture text complexity by looking at some statistical parameters of the text such as the word length and count, the number of words and unique words used, the number of sentences, and so on. \n",
    "- We will use the pandas and scikit-learn libraries, and we will make a shallow dive into a very useful Python NLP toolkit called Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)."

    "- In the same way, when we speak, we use many short words such as articles and prepositions to build the sentence structure, yet the main concept is often derived by the nouns and adjectives we use, which tend to be longer words. \n",
